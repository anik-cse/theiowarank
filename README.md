## How do I turn off Teams?

Jetstream's team scaffolding and opinions may not work for every application. If it doesn't work for your use case, feel free to turn off team functionality. To turn off, all you need to do is:


1. **Go to**```config/jetstream.php``` **and scroll down to** ```Features``` **section**
```
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Features
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Some of Jetstream's features are optional. You may disable the features
    | by removing them from this array. You're free to only remove some of
    | these features or you can even remove all of these if you need to.
    |
    */

    'features' => [
        // Features::termsAndPrivacyPolicy(),
        Features::profilePhotos(),
        // Features::api(),
        Features::teams(['invitations' => true]),
        Features::accountDeletion(),
    ],
```


2. **Now comment out** ```Features::teams(['invitations' => true])``` **this line of code**
```
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Features
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Some of Jetstream's features are optional. You may disable the features
    | by removing them from this array. You're free to only remove some of
    | these features or you can even remove all of these if you need to.
    |
    */

    'features' => [
        // Features::termsAndPrivacyPolicy(),
        Features::profilePhotos(),
        // Features::api(),
        //Features::teams(['invitations' => true]),
        Features::accountDeletion(),
    ],
```
